/**
 * Every subcommand must brand its log directory — asserted BEHAVIOURALLY.
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE, AND WHY THREE SIMPLER VERSIONS WERE REJECTED
 *
 * The logger fixes its file path at the FIRST WRITE and derives the directory
 * from whatever prefix is set at that instant. Two different defects put logs
 * in the shared `$TMPDIR/mcp/` bucket: branding called too LATE, and branding
 * NEVER called. A third cause turned out to be neither — a dependency
 * resolving its own copy of the logger, so the app branded an instance the
 * dispatcher never wrote through.
 *
 * Three cheaper checks were considered and rejected:
 *
 *  1. "Assert every entry point calls setLogFilePrefix" — a static list. It
 *     would have caught `cli.ts` only if somebody had listed `cli.ts`, which is
 *     exactly what nobody did. And `commands/http.ts` has zero calls and is
 *     nonetheless correct, so the check has to reason about that false positive
 *     to stay useful.
 *  2. A runtime warning emitted through the logger — it would be written INTO
 *     the mis-located file, the one directory nothing collects.
 *  3. A hook at the logger's first file open — a default nobody overrode is
 *     indistinguishable from a default nobody meant to override, so it
 *     false-positives on every tool that never brands deliberately.
 *
 * This asserts the OBSERVABLE OUTCOME instead, so it catches all three causes
 * without needing to tell them apart — including causes nobody has thought of.
 *
 * THE SUBCOMMAND LIST COMES FROM THE BIN'S OWN `--help`, never from a literal
 * here. A hand-written list is the same failure as (1): a subcommand added
 * tomorrow is covered the day it is registered, not the day someone remembers
 * to update this file.
 *
 * ACCEPTED GAP, stated rather than papered over: library entry points imported
 * in-process (vitest workers) are not covered. How to cover them is unknown and
 * was deliberately not invented.
