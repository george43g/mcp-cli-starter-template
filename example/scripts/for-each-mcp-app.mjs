/**
 * for-each-mcp-app.mjs — run `pnpm --filter <app> <args…>` for EVERY MCP app.
 *
 *   node scripts/for-each-mcp-app.mjs check:usage
 *   node scripts/for-each-mcp-app.mjs stress
 *   node scripts/for-each-mcp-app.mjs exec npm pack --dry-run
 *
 * The set comes from scripts/lib/mcp-apps.mjs (the mcp-kit dependency marker),
 * never from a name-shaped filter. `pnpm --filter "<scope>/*-mcp" <script>`
 * exits 0 when it matches nothing, so an app without the suffix was silently
 * ungated and the step still went green (DEFERRED #52, measured on pnpm
 * 10.29.3). Deriving the set makes that drift impossible rather than merely
 * detectable: a new app is gated because it depends on mcp-kit, not because
 * someone remembered to widen a filter.
 *
 * Zero MCP apps is a skip, not a failure: it prints one line naming the marker
 * and exits 0, because a monorepo of non-MCP apps is a legitimate shape and the
 * dependency marker cannot miss an app the way a name filter could (reasoning
 * in lib/mcp-apps.mjs). A usage error (no command) and a marked workspace with
 * no package name still fail — neither is "this repo has no MCP apps".
 *
 * One deliberate difference from the glob it replaces:
 *   - One `pnpm --filter <exact-name>` per app, so an app missing the script
 *     fails instead of being carried by a sibling that has it. pnpm's recursive
 *     run only errors when NONE of the selected packages has the script
 *     (ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_NO_SCRIPT), which is the same vacuous-pass shape.
 *
 * Every app runs even after one fails, so CI reports the whole picture.

/**
 * How to run pnpm without assuming `spawn("pnpm")` works — it does not on
 * Windows, where pnpm on PATH is `pnpm.cmd` and spawn only resolves `.cmd`
 * through a shell (ENOENT otherwise; measured on windows-latest).
 *
 * 1. Under `pnpm run`, npm_execpath is pnpm itself: its JS entry (run it with
 *    this node) or a standalone binary (spawn it directly). No shell at all.
 *    The basename must say pnpm: under `npm run` it is npm-cli.js, and
 *    `npm --filter …` is not what was asked for.
 * 2. Otherwise (`node scripts/for-each-mcp-app.mjs …` straight from CI), POSIX
 *    spawns `pnpm` directly and Windows goes through cmd.exe as ONE command
 *    string. One string, not `shell: true` plus an args array: Node 24
 *    deprecates that pair (DEP0190) because it concatenates without escaping.
 *    The args are package and script names from this repo, never user input;
 *    each is still double-quoted when it holds anything cmd.exe would read.
